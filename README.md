This game is an implementation of a game idea I've had for a while. If you are reading this, the game is in progress, and further documentation is on the way!

The game is deployed to github pages here: https://qu-1ll.github.io/TriloGame/ 

Feel free to click around, although there isn't much to do yet . . .

What I've got working so far:
  - Random map generation (<mark>reload the page</mark> to regenerate)
  - Zooming in and out
  - Clicking and dragging to move view
  - "Mining" a cave wall (<mark>click on a wall tile</mark> to "mine" it)
  - Selecting objects (<mark>click on a trilobite or building</mark> to select it)
  - Building a building (<mark>select the "build" option</mark> from the trilobite's menu)
  - Assigning a trilobite's movement (<mark>select the "move" option</mark> from the trilobite's menu)
  - Trilobites executing movement (<mark>press enter</mark> once a path has been assigned)
  - Trilobite menu
  - Selecting a building from the menu and placing it
  - Exiting a workflow with no glitches (<mark>press "esc"</mark> with any UI elements open)

What's coming soon:
  - Building menu
  - Building functionality
  - Automatic trilobite behavior/movement
  - Mining ores and walls with trilobites
  - Collecting resources
  - Home menu
  - Saving progress (Once there is progress to be made)
  - **MUCH MORE!**
