This game is an implementation of a game idea I've had for a while. If you are reading this, the gam is in progress, and further documentation is on the way!

The game is deployed to github pages here: https://qu-1ll.github.io/TriloGame/ 

Feel free to click around, although there isn't much to do yet . .
